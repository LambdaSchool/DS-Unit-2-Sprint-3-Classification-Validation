Given the current model, we fit a decision model to the residuals from the current model. We then add this new model into the fitted function in order to update the residuals.

Conventional algorithms are often biased towards the majority class because their loss functions attempt to optimize quantities such as error rate, not taking the data distribution into consideration2. In the worst case, minority examples are treated as outliers of the majority class and ignored.
